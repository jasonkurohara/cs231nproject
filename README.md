# cs231nproject

<<<<<<< HEAD
This repo is for our Stanford CS231n class project. We implement a object detector and object tracker on UAV footage of moving vehicles.
=======
This repository is for our final CS231n Project at Stanford University. We seek to detect vehicles from an aerial camera captured by a UAV. We are currently using YOLOv3 to detect objects and SORT architecture for tracking the detected objects.
